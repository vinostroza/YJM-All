            Youth Justice Milwaukee (YJM), was formed in 2016 to address the current crisis with youth prisons
            in Wisconsin. YJM seeks to learn from and incorporate models and approaches from other jurisdictions
            and states that have closed youth prisons and replaced them with better and more cost-effective, continuums
            of services for adjudicated youth. YJM is a collective voice of persons who were incarcerated as youth,
            families of those who were or are currently incarcerated as youth, local advocates for youth, and national 
            experts on youth justice.
