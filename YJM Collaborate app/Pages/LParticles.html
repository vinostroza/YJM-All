                        Leaders On Youth Justice Reform </a> </h2>
                        <p>Milwaukee, WI – Today, Youth Justice Milwaukee (YJM) held a roundtable meeting with Milwaukee County representatives, local aldermen, state officials and other elected officials, 
                          to discuss next steps after the closure of Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake youth prisons. YJM presented officials with alternatives to locking young people up and demonstrated how nonresidential programs successfully hold young people accountable without removing them from their supportive communities, which inflicts unnecessary trauma and makes rehabilitation impossible.</p>

                  <h2>Op Ed: Don't wait to close Lincoln Hills</h2> 
                  <p>Milwaukee Journal Sentinel,  January 9, 2018

                      by Jeff Roman and Sharlen Moore
                      
                      Whatever his real motivations are for proposing to close Lincoln Hills and Copper Lake in his fiscal year 2019 budget, Gov. Scott Walker has finally come around to the obvious conclusion that Wisconsin’s notoriously dangerous youth prisons — which lawsuits and federal investigations have repeatedly identified as abusive and obsolete — need to close. 
                      In response to pressure from the community, Walker has tacitly admitted that locking up Wisconsin’s kids in these treacherous facilities is unacceptable.</p>
