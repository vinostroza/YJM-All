                                    <p><em>March 2017</em></p>
                                    <p>Despite declines in juvenile arrests and incarceration, Wisconsin still holds a
                                        considerable number of youth in juvenile correctional facilities, most of whom
                                        come from Milwaukee County.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> In February
                                        2017, well over half (60 percent) of the youth committed to facilities in
                                        Wisconsin were from Milwaukee County.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>

                                    <h2>Juvenile Correctional Facilities Have High Costs with Poor Returns</h2>
                                    <p>The cost of incarceration for youth in Wisconsin is high; in fiscal year 2014–15,
                                        the state spent over $30 million on the operation of its juvenile correctional
                                        facilities.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> The return on that
                                        investment is poor: more than half of youth (61 percent) who were released from
                                        incarceration in Wisconsin committed a new criminal offense within three years
                                        of release, according to the most recent data (DJC 2015, 5).</p>

                                    </ul>
                                    <p>While juvenile arrest and detention rates have declined significantly across
                                        Milwaukee County, the racial disparity in these measures appears to be widening.
                                        Between 2006 and 2013 the arrest and detention rates for Black youth dropped
                                        40.6 percent and 22.3 percent; the arrest and detention rates for their White
                                        peers dropped 54.4 percent and 47.6 percent (Lecoanet et al. 2014). From 2006 to
                                        2012, Black youth went from twice as likely as White youth to be arrested for a
                                        violent or property crime to three times more likely to be arrested for a
                                        violent crime, and four times more likely to be arrested for a property crime
                                        (Lecoanet et al. 2014).</p>
                                    <h2>Recent Lawsuit</h2>
                                    <p>In January 2017, the ACLU filed a federal lawsuit against the two primary
                                        juvenile correctional facilities in Wisconsin, Lincoln Hills School for Boys and
                                        Copper Lake School for Girls, on behalf of four currently and formerly
                                        incarcerated youth. The lawsuit raises major concerns surrounding the safety of
                                        these facilities, alleging that guards in the prisons physically abused
                                        incarcerated youth, routinely used pepper spray as a punishment tactic, and held
                                        as many as 20 percent of the population in solitary confinement for 23 hours a
                                        day. This follows an FBI investigation into allegations of abuse at Lincoln
                                        Hills that began in 2015 and has yet to result in charges. The ACLU has
                                        requested class action status for this suit in order to continue representation
                                        on behalf of all 170 currently incarcerated teens in the facility.<a

                                    <h2>Alternative Models Have Shown Success</h2>
                                    <p>Between 1999 and 2013, admissions to Wisconsin’s juvenile correctional facilities
                                        dropped 75 percent, and that dramatic trend appears to be continuing.<a
                                            href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> Following that decline, there has been
                                        a general trend toward alternatives to incarceration for youth. Since 2011, two
                                        juvenile correctional facilities have closed, and an alternative education
                                        facility (the Grow Academy) has opened (Carmichael 2015, 19, 27). Other states
                                        across the country have improved recidivism outcomes while reducing costs and
                                        reallocating resources through incarceration alternatives. For example, Missouri
                                        has had great success with its growth-focused model, which deviates from the
                                        large prisonlike institution model to offer services to youth in smaller
                                        settings closer to their homes. New York City has also seen success with its
                                        Close-to-Home program, and states and counties across the nation are
                                        increasingly moving toward these models as alternatives to juvenile prisons. As
                                        incarceration continues to decline in Milwaukee, there is a unique opportunity
                                        to invest in alternative models that show promise, working to improve outcomes
                                        for all Milwaukee County residents.</p>

                                        <h2>Poll Results on Youth Justice Reform in Milwaukee County</h2>
                                        <p>
                                            At a time when partisan polarization dominates the political landscape, a
                                            new poll shows Milwaukee County residents of all political stripes support
                                            shifting the youth justice system from a focus on incarceration and
                                            punishment to prevention and rehabilitation. A strong 65% majority favors
                                            this shift, with broad support across partisan affiliations in the state
                                            (65% of Democrats, 71% of Independents, and 57% of Republicans).

                                            The following are key findings from the survey of 400 adults in Milwaukee
                                            County in the state of Wisconsin age 18+:

                                            Strong Support for Proposals to Reform Youth Justice System in Milwaukee
                                            County

                                            The broad support for this shift to reform by Milwaukee County residents is
                                            reinforced by support for a number of specific policy proposals aimed at
                                            addressing problems with the youth justice system, including the misguided
                                            focus on incarceration, racial and ethnic disparities in the system and the
                                            shortage of public defenders.
